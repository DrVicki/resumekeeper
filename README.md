# ResumeKeeper

ResumeKeeper is a project for my students in the **AI in Action Bootcamp**.

Using engineered prompts, they create an AI Resume Agent, which then prompts them for the information to create an awesome Resume.

The Project is completed in Firebase Studio, using AI, Gemini, and a code editor.
