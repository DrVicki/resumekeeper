# **App Name**: ResumeKeeper

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login flows to protect personal resume data, ensuring each user has their own private workspace.
- Profile Management: Comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for 'Basics', 'Experience', and 'Education' sections, supporting edit/update flows for all entries. The UI will enforce a rule of exactly 3 responsibilities per job entry in the 'Experience' section.
- AI-Powered 'About' Generation: Utilize generative AI as a tool to create an 80-120 word 'About' paragraph and a concise 1-2 sentence short bio based on keywords and information provided in other profile sections.
- Project Management: Functionality to add, edit, and delete projects. Users can include projects by providing a URL or uploading relevant files. Each project must contain at least one evidence source (URL or uploaded file).
- Portfolio Publish & Preview: A dedicated page to preview the compiled resume and portfolio data in a clean, modern layout before publication. This feature allows users to see their online presence as potential employers or clients would.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color: A deep, professional indigo (#483582) is chosen to convey reliability and sophistication, serving as the main brand color in a light color scheme. Its richness provides excellent contrast for text and interactive elements.
- Background Color: A very light, almost off-white with a subtle cool purple tint (#F7F8F9) ensures a clean, spacious, and calming backdrop. This highly desaturated shade enhances content readability and contributes to a professional aesthetic.
- Accent Color: A bright, clear sky blue (#5C95DB) is used for interactive elements, highlights, and calls to action. This analogous color to the primary creates a dynamic contrast while maintaining harmony and guiding user focus effectively.
- Body and Headline Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) is recommended for all text. Its modern, highly legible, and objective characteristics ensure clarity and professionalism across both headlines and longer body text sections, aligning with the app's accessible UI goal.
- Employ a consistent set of minimal, line-art or outline-style icons. These icons will be straightforward and universally understandable, supporting navigation and interaction without adding visual clutter.
- The layout will be clean, responsive, and content-centric, designed with generous whitespace to promote ease of reading and a polished professional appearance. Structured tab navigation on the 'Profile' page will maintain a clear information hierarchy.
- Subtle and purposeful animations, such as smooth transitions for tab switching, form expansions, and success notifications, will enhance user experience by providing gentle visual feedback without causing distraction.
